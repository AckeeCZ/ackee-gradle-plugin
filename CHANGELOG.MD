## [Unreleased]

## [3.3.2] - 2025-09-13
### Changed
- Add verification of source and target folders in CopyGitHooksTask and register the task only if both 
folders exist.

## [3.3.1] - 2025-09-11

## [3.3.0] - 2025-05-27
### Removed
- Support for Gradle plugins for checking outdated dependencies and vulnerable dependencies. The
existing integration on CI using Danger was not convenient and we have now other process for updating
dependencies. Updating dependencies does maximum for fixing vulnerabilities as well.

## [3.2.0] - 2024-03-05
### Added
- Support for Gradle plugins for checking outdated dependencies and vulnerable dependencies. This 
version is compatible with Danger plugin https://github.com/AckeeCZ/danger-kotlin-dependencies-check
of version 1.0.0. Newly added Gradle plugins are:
  * https://github.com/jeremylong/DependencyCheck
  * https://github.com/ben-manes/gradle-versions-plugin

## [3.1.6] - 2023-09-07

### Fixed

- Fix unnecessary dependency between `copyMappingFile` task and `checkChagelogTask`

## [3.1.5] - 2023-09-01

### Fixed

- `CheckChangelogFileTask` now supports configuration cache too

## [3.1.4] - 2023-09-01

### Changed

- Update all dependencies to the latest where possible

## [3.1.3] - 2023-07-31

### Fixed

- Fix external execution to support configuration cache
- Fix getting AGP tasks
  - Tasks should be configured via `configureEach` instead of using `whenTaskAdded`

## [3.1.2] - 2023-06-23

### Fixed
- Applying default proguard file
  - Proguard file `proguard-android-optimize.txt` is now referenced via `getDefaultProguardFile`
    and being applied correctly.

## [3.1.1] - 2023-05-14

### Fixed
- Copying artifacts
  - Copying tasks are now added to the task graph via `finalizedBy` instead of `wiredWith`, 
    which previously caused errors during building. This issue was likely caused 
    by some AGP bug, as the output file provided to the task by AGP did not match 
    the expected input path for the subsequent task.

Release builds can still be built locally if you define a local `keystore.properties` file like:  
```
# keystore.properties
# keystore file should be located in a dir named keystore/ in the project root
#   E.G. MyApp/keystore/debug.keystore
key_alias=[project]
key_password=[keystore password]
key_file=[keystore file name] # E.G. debug.keystore
